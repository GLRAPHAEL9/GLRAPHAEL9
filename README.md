### 👨‍💻 About Me

A Graduate Software Developer with an MSc in Artificial Intelligence and a unique journey into tech.

Before entering the world of software development, I was deeply involved in competitive sports, primarily football and basketball. The discipline, teamwork, and resilience I developed on the court and the pitch have been invaluable in shaping my approach to problem-solving and continuous learning in technology.

Driven by curiosity and a passion for innovation, I transitioned into coding, starting with small automation projects and eventually advancing to earn my MSc in AI. Today, I combine my strong foundation in software engineering with applied machine learning and natural language processing to build impactful, user-focused solutions.

I’m eager to contribute to early-career software roles where I can grow as an engineer, collaborate with dynamic teams, and create meaningful software that makes a difference.
